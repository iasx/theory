# Principles


### Abstraction



### Modularity

The whole system's functionality is divided into many components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system.

The division may take place at different levels of abstraction. High-level components provide specific services or features, while low-level components are responsible for particular tasks. Modules gather components into larger logical units, which can be further divided into sub-modules.

For example, in a banking application, a high-level module might be responsible for managing user accounts and the authentication process, while a low-level component might be responsible for validating the password against active policies.

This approach allows for better organization, easier maintenance, and more efficient development. It also enables the reuse of components in different systems, as well as the seamless replacement of components with newer or more efficient ones without negatively affecting the system's integrity.
